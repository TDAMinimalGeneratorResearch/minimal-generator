This crate provides support for reading/writing [`ndarray`]'s `ArrayBase` type
from/to [`.npy`] and [`.npz`] files. See the
[documentation](https://docs.rs/ndarray-npy) for more information.

[`ndarray`]: https://github.com/bluss/ndarray
[`.npy`]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html
[`.npz`]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html

**This crate is a work-in-progress.** It currently supports only a subset of
`.npy` header descriptors and supports only primitive fixed-size integer,
floating point, and `bool` types as the array element type. You can implement
the `*Element` traits for your own types, but the next breaking release of this
library will probably change those traits.

Future plans include support for:

* Memory-mapped `.npz` files. (Memory-mapped `.npy` files are already
  supported.)
* More element types (e.g. structs). If you need support for structs before
  this is implemented in `ndarray-npy`, check out the [`npy` crate].
* Possibly merging this with the [`npy` crate].

[`npy` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/npy

## Using with Cargo

To use with the default features:

```toml
[dependencies]
ndarray-npy = "0.8"
```

The `default` feature set includes the `compressed_npz` feature, which enables
support for uncompresssed and compressed `.npz` files. This requires a
dependency on the [`zip` crate] and a compression backend crate.

To use without the default features:

```toml
[dependencies]
ndarray-npy = { version = "0.8", default-features = false }
```

With `default-features = false`, `ndarray-npy` provides support only for `.npy`
files, not `.npz` files. If you want `.npz` file support, you can select
additional features:

* `npz` enables support for uncompressed `.npz` files. This requires a
  dependency on the [`zip` crate].
* `compressed_npz` enables support for uncompressed and compressed `.npz`
  files. This requires a dependency on the [`zip` crate] and a compression
  backend crate.

For example, you can use just the `npz` feature:

```toml
[dependencies.ndarray-npy]
version = "0.8"
default-features = false
features = ["npz"]
```

[`zip` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/zip

### Library authors

Library authors should specify their dependency on `ndarray-npy` like this:

```toml
[dependencies.ndarray-npy]
version = "0.8"
default-features = false
features = [FEATURES_LIST_HERE]
```

where the `features` list is one of the following:

* `[]` if your crate does not depend on `.npz` file support
* `["npz"]` if your crate depends on `.npz` file support but not compression
* `["compressed_npz"]` if your crate depends on `.npz` file support with compression

## Releases

* **0.8.0**

  * Updated to `ndarray` 0.15.
  * Updated to `py_literal` 0.4.
  * Updated to Rust 1.49.

* **0.7.2**

  * Added a `.finish()` method to `NpzWriter`. All users of `NpzWriter` should
    call this method, after the write of the last array, in order to properly
    handle errors. (Without calling `.finish()`, dropping will automatically
    attempt to finish the file, but errors will be silently ignored.)
  * Changed the `write_npy` convenience function and the `NpzWriter::add_array`
    method to buffer writes using `BufWriter`. This significantly improves
    write performance for arrays which are not in standard or Fortran layout.
    The docs of `WriteNpyExt::write_npy` have also been updated to recommend
    that users wrap the writer in a `BufWriter`. Thanks to @bluss for
    mentioning the unbuffered writes issue.
  * Changed `WriteNpyExt::write_npy` to always call `.flush()` before
    returning. This is convenient when the writer passed to
    `WriteNpyExt::write_npy` is wrapped in a `BufWriter`.

* **0.7.1**

  * Added support for viewing byte slices as `.npy` files, primarily for use
    with memory-mapped files. See the `ViewNpyExt` and `ViewMutNpyExt`
    extension traits. By @n3vu0r and @jturner314.
  * Added support for creating files larger than available memory with
    `write_zeroed_npy`.
  * Improved handling of overflow in the number of bytes to read as specified
    by the shape and element type in the `.npy` file header. Before, if the
    number of bytes of data was more than `isize::MAX`, the implementation
    would attempt to create the array anyway and panic. Now, it detects this
    case before attempting to create the array and returns
    `Err(ReadNpyError::LengthOverflow)` instead.

* **0.7.0**

  * Updated to `ndarray` 0.14.
  * Updated to Rust 1.42.

* **0.6.0**

  * Changed `write_npy` to take the array by reference instead of by value, by
    @flaghacker.

* **0.5.0**

  * Updated to `ndarray` 0.13.
  * Updated to Rust 1.38.
  * Added `read_npy` and `write_npy` convenience functions.
  * Added support for `npy` format version 3.0.
  * Renamed `ReadableElement::read_vec` to `::read_to_end_exact_vec`.
  * Refactored the error types and variants, including removing the associated
    `Error` type from `Readable/WritableElement` and updating to the new style
    of `std::error::Error` implementation.
  * Updated the padding calculation to make the total header length be
    divisible by 64 instead of just 16 when writing files. (See
    [numpy/numpy#9025](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/9025).)
  * Fixed determination of file format version when the addition of padding
    changes the required version when writing the file.
  * Fixed miscellaneous bugs related to overflow and error handling.

* **0.4.0**

  * Added support for reading/writing arrays of `bool`, by @tobni and
    @jturner314.
  * Updated to `zip` 0.5.
  * Updated to Rust 1.32.
  * Renamed the `compressed_npz_default` feature to `compressed_npz` because
    the `zip` crate no longer allows the user to select the compression
    backend.

* **0.3.0**

  * Updated to `ndarray` 0.12.
  * Updated to `num-traits` 0.2 (replacing dependency on `num`).
  * Updated to `py_literal` 0.2.

* **0.2.0**

  * Updated to `zip` 0.4.
  * Made the compression backend for compressed `.npz` files user-selectable.
  * Reworked how feature selection works. This should only affect you if you
    use `default-features = false, features = ["compressed_npz"]`.

* **0.1.1**

  * Improved crate documentation (no functional changes).

* **0.1.0**

  * Initial release.
